PARAMETER TUNING SUGGESTIONS:
----------------------------------------

IRLS:
  - Adjust Tukey constant (try 0.06-0.12 range)
  - Consider filtering input points to bottom 25% by height

RANSAC:
  - Increase tolerance (try 0.08-0.12m for RealSense noise)
  - Pre-filter candidate points to improve convergence

V-Disparity:
  - Verify stereo baseline parameter matches camera
  - Check depth range filtering (0.2-8.0m recommended)
  - Ensure proper camera calibration for best results
